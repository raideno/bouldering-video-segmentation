    \textbf{For Now I Have:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed DataLoaders, PreProcessors and Datasets to have training ready data.
        \item Read papers to identify what techniques are used to solve our problem.
        \item Tested and experimented with different models adn techniques.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Current Challenges \& Problems:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Not enough overall accuracy.
        \item Limited dataset size constraining model performance.
        \item Significant detection issues with stopwatch sequences.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{In the Future we'll be:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Take advantage of our un-annotated videos using semi supervised learning.
        \item Exploring advanced architectures including Vision Transformers.
        \item Enhancing model robustness and classification performance.
    \end{itemize}

% NOTE: maybe discuss about data augmentation and how it can help us with the lack of data.
