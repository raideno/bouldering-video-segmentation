    \textbf{Data Preparation \& Pre-Processing:}

    \vspace{0.5em}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Agreed on a format for the annotations and the videos with the domain experts.
        % NOTE: To effectively work with our Dataset 
        \item Developed special \textbf{Data Loaders} and \textbf{Data Preprocessors} using Pytorch.
        % NOTE: To reduce the time required for loading the dataset
        \item Search about effective ways to store and load videos datasets in Pytorch.
        % NOTE: To load clips effectively, etc
        \item Developed a custom \textbf{Video Dataset} to efficiently load the data with Pytorch.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Benefits \& Importance of this preliminary work:}

    \vspace{0.5em}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Allow us to quickly iterate test different models effectively and quickly.
        \item On top of that this will make it easy on the future to add new videos to the training set.
    \end{itemize}

% NOTE: say that i learned a lot about videos datasets and how to handle them, choose the right encoding, store in images, etc. Pytorch transformers, etc.
