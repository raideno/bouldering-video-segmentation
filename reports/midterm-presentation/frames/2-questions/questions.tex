    \begin{itemize}
        \item How to construct our dataset ? \underline{By Frame} ? \underline{By Segment} ? \underline{By Clip} ?
        \item How to measure the accuracy ? at the \underbar{Frame Level} ? At the \underline{Segment Level} ?
        % NOTE: talk about the climbing classes and how they are not balanced. And thus maybe we should penalize it more ?
        \item Penalize more the model for miss predicting a specific class ?
        \item \underline{Post Processing} using priors ?
        \item How to take advantage of our un-annotated videos ? \underline{Semi Supervised Learning} ?
    \end{itemize}

% NOTE: - s7: Par exemple:  "Should we use any Post Treatment on the predicted video annotations ?" ->  "Post processing using priors?" (on a des priors sur des durées d'actions, ..., des ordres) pour éviter des phrases.

% NOTE: these slides serves to show that we have taken some perspective ("du recul") on the problem.
% NOTE: follow this by the fact that we shouldn't share videos between the testing and validation set otherwise we'll have biased accuracy.
