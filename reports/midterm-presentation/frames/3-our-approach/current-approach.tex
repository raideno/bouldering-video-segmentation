        \begin{itemize}
            \item Faster to train.
            \item More powerful networks.
            \item Uses network's pre-learned patterns.

% NOTE: say that: "we basically remove the last layer of the network and use the previous layer as a feature extractors and we put a simple MLP on top of it for doing classifications on this layer."
% NOTE: explain quickly what is fine tuning.
% NOTE: remind that the kinetics dataset include sports related activities.

% NOTE: the networks trained on huge datasets such as the kinetics 690 contains a lot of activities.

% NOTE: justify and discuss the results we got, maybe imprecision, not enough fine tuning / training, etc.
