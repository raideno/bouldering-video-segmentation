% NOTE: say what the embedding models tries to do.

% NOTE: talk about semi supervised learning methods or unsupervised learning methods.
% NOTE: explain quickly the neural networks cited above.
% NOTE: for 3D CNNs to perform classification on small portions of the videos (usually from 8 to 32 frames).

% NOTE: about skeleton based approach: When Humans are involved some techniques (Cite the papers that uses this techniques) uses the humans skeletons points to perform classification.

% TODO: cite other models from the SOTA recap paper
% TODO: cite all the models
% TODO: cite at least a paper that uses a skeleton based approach.
