    This research project focuses on temporal action segmentation in professional bouldering videos.
    The objective is to classify each frame of a video based on the climberâ€™s activity to enable a detailed analysis of their performance.
    The project leverages pre-trained networks, which are crucial for addressing the dataset's limited size by providing robust spatio-temporal feature extraction.
    These features are then combined with either a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for classification.
    The dataset, collected during a bouldering competition, presents several challenges, including class imbalance, noise, and limited size.
    \\\\
    Experimental results demonstrate that models incorporating temporal context significantly outperform frame-based approaches.
    Notably, the X3D-M model with an LSTM classifier achieves the highest accuracy of 86.61\%.
    This work contributes valuable insights into effective model selection for bouldering video analysis and highlights potential improvements for real-world applications.
    % Future work will focus on enhancing real-time capabilities, exploring alternative loss functions, and expanding the dataset through semi-supervised learning techniques.
    The code and dataset used in this project are available at: \url{https://github.com/raideno/bouldering-video-segmentation}.
