    This research project focuses on temporal action segmentation in professional bouldering videos. The objective is to classify each frame of a video based on the climberâ€™s activity to enable a detailed analysis of their performance. The project leverages pre-trained networks to extract spatio-temporal features, combining these with either a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for classification. The dataset, collected during a bouldering competition, presents several challenges, including class imbalance, noise, and limited size. Experimental results demonstrate that models incorporating temporal context significantly outperform frame-based approaches. Notably, the X3D-M model with an LSTM classifier achieves the highest accuracy of 86.61\%. This work contributes valuable insights into effective model selection for bouldering video analysis and highlights potential improvements for real-world applications. Future work will focus on enhancing real-time capabilities, exploring alternative loss functions, and expanding the dataset through semi-supervised learning techniques.
