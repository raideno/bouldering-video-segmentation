Table to recap the results (accuracy, loss, mof, f1-score, etc) we got for each variant, in addition on the end of the table include the accuracy score for SotA methods on the kinetics dataset in order for the reader to have a reference to compare to.

For each model variant in the table, include the number parameters, training time, number of epochs, etc.

Justify the results we got for each model, for example the s3d-howto100m cuz of the type of videos the dataset contain, etc.

Display per class accuracy for ech model in a separate table or something.

Finalize by talking about the performance of each model and which one we should choose based on the requirements (if we need accuracy on a specific class, speed and inference time, model size, etc).

\todo[inline]{Maybe put this in the appendix for all the models and here display only one example, the best one.}
Show an illustration / example of segmentation and statistics of different models.
