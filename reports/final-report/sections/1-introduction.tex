\section{Introduction}

Here we are going to provide the essential background information.

\todo[inline]{This section might be removed as since we are in report mode and not research mode, we might not need to provide the background information or at least not this early in the report.}

\todo[inline]{Talk about the fact that the data quality is the most important thing and maybe even more important than the model architecture and size and dataset size.}

\todo[inline]{Maybe merge this section with the context or we should put it before after the context ?}

% NOTE: if we talk about TAS in here we could talk about the evolution of TAS, its importance, applications, etc
