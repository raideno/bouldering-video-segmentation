Talk about using a different loss, other training techniques and models such as transformers, etc.

Talk about self supervision, annotating the videos using our best performing model or a mix of models and reuse this annotations to retrain our model with a lower loss. Validation wouldn't be performed on this videos as it would be biased, they would only be used for training.

Talk about data augmentation.

\todo[inline]{This should maybe be done in the results section ?}
Criticize our model and tell its drawbacks and limitations.
