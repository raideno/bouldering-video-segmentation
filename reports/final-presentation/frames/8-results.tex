    \begin{itemize}
        \itemsep1em
        \item Segment-based models consistently outperform frame-based models.
        \item YOLO-based skeleton features and S3D-H models underperformed significantly.
        \item Model size doesnâ€™t always correlate with performance; lighter models can perform better.
        \item LSTM classifiers generally improve accuracy and reduce variance.
        \item R3D with LSTM achieves the highest accuracy for accuracy-critical applications.
        \item X3D-XS with MLP offers a good trade-off for resource-constrained environments.
    \end{itemize}

    % TODO: display some segments examples.
